Ques. 12. Three students (a, b, c) are arriving in the mess at the same time. The id numbers of these students
are 2132, 2102, 2453 and the food taken time from the mess table is 2, 4 and 8 minutes. If the two students have 
same remaining time so it is broken by giving priority to the students with the lowest id number. Consider the
longest remaining time first (LRTF) scheduling algorithm and calculate the average turnaround time and waiting time.

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
	int burst_time[20],remain_time[20],complete_time,left=0;
	int n;
	int arrival_time=5;
	
	printf("enter the Number of Students entered in the mess :");
	scanf("%d",&n);
	
	int x,Student_id[20];
	for(x=0;x<n;x++){
		printf("the Id of student %d: \n",x+1);
		scanf("%d",&Student_id[x]);
	}
	
	int i;
	for(i=0;i<n;i++){
		printf("student[%d] \n",i+1);
		printf("enter burst time: ");
		scanf("%d",&burst_time[i]);
		printf("\n");
	    remain_time[i]=burst_time[i];
	}
	
	int small,time;
	float total_wait = 0,total_turn_around = 0;
	remain_time[19]=0;
	for(time = 0;left != n;time++){
		small = 19;
		for(i=0;i<n;i++){
			if(arrival_time<=time && burst_time[i]>remain_time[small] && remain_time[i]>0){
				small = i;     
			}
		}
		remain_time[small]--;
		if(remain_time[small]==0){
			left++;
			complete_time = time ++;
			total_turn_around += complete_time - arrival_time;
			total_wait += complete_time - arrival_time- burst_time[small];
		}
	}
	printf("The average turn around time is: %f \n",total_turn_around/n);
	printf("The average waiting time is: %f",total_wait/n);
}
